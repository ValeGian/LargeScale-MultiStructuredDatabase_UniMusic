# LSMDB_UniMusic
Project for the <i>'Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases'</i> course

<b>UniMusic</b> is an application whose main purpose is to provide a song search and management service; songs that can be found on the platform are associated with links to official sources on the Internet, where users can listen to them (for example, official YouTube / Spotify source).
The application provides general information about each stored song (e.g. name, genre, artist) and offers users the ability to search and browse them, possibly applying specific
filters to narrow the search scope. Users can then express their thoughts on the songs through a "like" system and possibly add them to favorites.
In order to simplify and improve user experience, it's possible to organize songs into playlists or follow other people's playlists. Users can also follow other users to get suggestions on songs and playlists you might like.
